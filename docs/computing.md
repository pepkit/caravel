# Changing caravel computing options

`Caravel`, like `looper`, uses [divvy](http://divvy.databio.org) for computing configuration. This makes it easy to switch your computing options on-the-fly, and so you only have to configure your environment once.

To access the options, click on the "Preferences <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i>" tab. From this interface, you can select any available compute packages. Consult the [divvy documentation](http://divvy.databio.org) to see how to configure your environment.
